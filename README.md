# BuildMigrator - migrate your builds to Bazel or CMake

BuildMigrator automates migration from Autotools (make), Ninja or MSBuild
to Bazel or CMake. It achieves that by parsing build logs and generating a
CMakeLists.txt or BUILD.bazel script for discovered build artifacts. Additionally,
it helps remove unused files by keeping track of files that were used during
compilation.

BuildMigrator is intended for use in Monorepo-style projects with lots of
third party dependencies that require a homogenous build process and clean
source tree.

Supported log types:

- Autotools (make)
- Ninja
- MSBuild
- strace

Supported languages:

- C/C++ (GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Assembler (Netwide, MASM, GNU, Yasm)
- Objective C/C++
- Resource files (.rc)

Supported target platforms:

- Windows
- Linux
- Darwin (macOS, iOS)
- Our tests show that other platforms like FreeBSD and Android are covered by Linux support.

BuildMigrator was battle-tested on many libraries, including:

- Boost
- ICU
- jemalloc
- libxml2
- libxslt
- OpenSSL

**Important:** `Ninja` or `Unix Makefiles` CMake generators are recommended for building
CMakeLists.txt created by BuildMigrator.
Usage of `Visual Studio` generator is strongly discouraged due to a lack of correct compiler
option control in VS. See explanation: [VisualStudioGenerator.md](docs/VisualStudioGenerator.md).
